# 🏷️ ImageNet Data TrainingSet Foldername Calibration Using MATLAB

![Folder Rename Example](before_vs_after.png)

[ImageNet Dataset](https://www.image-net.org/) is universally considered the state-of-the-art dataset within the deep learning domain.  
However, the raw data downloaded from the website uses WordNet synset IDs (e.g., `n01440764`) as folder names, which are not intuitive.  
To address this, we developed a handy MATLAB tool to automatically rename the training folders into human-readable class names.
