# ImageNet Data TrainingSet Foldername Calibration Using MATLAB
![Model](before_vs_after.png)
[ImageNet Dataset](https://www.image-net.org/) is universally considered the state-of-the-art dataset within the deep learning domain. However, the raw data downloaded from the website is not well-organised. Thus, we have developed a handy program to help MATLAB users who work in the deep learning domain rename all folders of the training set into real class names by default in MATLAB.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## How To Use
* Download [ImageNet Dataset](https://www.image-net.org/) and unzip it into one folder.
* Download the code and unzip it into one folder (does not have to be the same with the ImageNet one).
* Open `Manual_Labelling.m` in MATLAB.
* Before executing the code, do remember to replace the directories with the local ones in your PC. :smile:
