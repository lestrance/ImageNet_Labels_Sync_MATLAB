# MATLAB ImageNet Data TrainingSet Foldername Calibration for Deep Learning
[ImageNet Dataset](https://www.image-net.org/) is universally considered the state-of-the-art dataset within the deep learning domain. However, the raw data downloaded from the website is not well-organised. Thus, we have developed a handy program to help MATLAB users who work in the deep learning domain rename all folders of the training set into real class names by default in MATLAB.
